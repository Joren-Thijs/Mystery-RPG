# Mystery-RPG
A 2D game built from scratch in Java using the JavaFx Framework.

# Project backstory
This game was my project for my university course software design in Java where i first encountered object oriented programming
after only having done some simple C en VB.Net stuff.

During the course of this project i learned a lot about programming and it pushed me to change my school major to Software Engineering.
The code in this project is far from perfect but i wanted to enclude it here anyway for educational purposes.
This project was made with the help of my project partner Sam Vanhove(No github).

Please note that i do not own the rights to any of the artwork. This code is only meant to be viewed for educational purposes.
